# Solus Cybersecurity project

Current Japanese regulation and insurance policies for offensive security arenâ€™t mandated for organisations in Japan when compared to the climate in Australia. We saw the rise of small offensive security firms in Australia growing more in demand due to increased government regulations in cybersecurity. 

The growth of technology and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks 

This business analysis project utilises python in order to determine the demand for offensive security measures in Japan, Australia and other first world countries. Overall objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of Solus Cybersecurity in entering the Japanese and Australian markets as well as offering solutions to proceed further.
